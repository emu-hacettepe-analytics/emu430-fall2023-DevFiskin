1.  Python and R has syntax difference.

    assignment operator in Python:

    ```

    assignment operator in R:

    ```         
    x <- 1
    x
    ```

2.writing function or a loop in R

````         
  ```
  for (i in 1:10) {
    print(i)
  }
  ```
  
````

writing fuction or a loop in Python `for i in range(1,11):     print(i)`

3.  if structure in Python \`\`\` if(5 \< 3) : print("Right")

```{r}
library("dslabs")
