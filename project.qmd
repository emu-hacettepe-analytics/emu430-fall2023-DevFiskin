**Summary**

Our project, done using R, checks out how crime has changed in Türkiye over 2011-2020, especially for different genders. We used R to analyze and show the patterns for different crimes. This helps us see when things changed, how different genders are involved, and gives useful info for people making decisions about laws and safety in Türkiye.
